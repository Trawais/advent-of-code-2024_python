# Advent of Code 2024

In Python, Yolo style.

## Prepare your environment
You must have `direnv` tool and some "newer" (3.12.*) `python` installed.
```shell
# Make your copy of direnv file
cp .envrc.dist .envrc
direnv allow
```

The Python interpreter should now be set from the local virtual environment folder.

Also don't forget to set the same Python interpreter in your IDE (VSCode preferably) to the same local virtual environment folder.

## Day 01
```shell
INPUT_FILE=day-01/example.input.txt python day-01/task.py
INPUT_FILE=day-01/puzzle.input.txt python day-01/task.py
```
